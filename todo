TODO
====================
- cleanup particle_shader_3d.hlsl
- optimize further
    - 3D texture, there's huge drop in perf at around 600 size
- thread size multiple of warp size
- flatten group count and group sizes
- imgs in repo to imgs folder

8/4/2019
- F3 to pause simulation
- 3D rendering, change cube  orientation based on camera position

6/4/2019
- particles accumulating in the corner
    - was because of invalid inputs to atan2/acos - zero vector
