====================
DOING
====================
- README update
- sampling of pairs line should depend on line length
- blit shader can be optimized, now is utilizing single thread per warp
- midi interaction when not using midi

====================
TODO
====================
- cleanup particle_shader_3d.hlsl
- optimize further
    - 3D texture, there's huge drop in perf at around 600 size
- thread size multiple of warp size
- flatten group count and group sizes
- move distance modified by max sampled value in 2D
- option to turn colors on/off - probably ifdef
    - might need ifdef support in shaders
- better rendering of colors
    - switchable between constant opacity and density view
    - render slices back to forth always
- render as voxels

====================
DONE
====================
16/4/2019
- Don't rotate 3D cube
- Don't move camera when using UI

15/4/2019
- more general 3D sampling
- modify move distance by max sampled value
- imgs in repo to imgs folder

14/4/2019
- update README with 3D
- cleanup a bit particle_shader_3d.hlsl

13/4/2019
- 9-neighborhood
- WIDTH/HEIGHT/DEPTH as constants to shaders
- solve abrupt changes in 3D texture rendering when cube rotation changes

12/4/2019
- add auto-rotation of camera
- add grid over 3D texture

11/4/2019
- optimize AoS -> AoS for particle array

9/4/2019
- D3D object release for 3D
- Debug speed issues

8/4/2019
- F3 to pause simulation
- 3D rendering, change cube  orientation based on camera position

6/4/2019
- particles accumulating in the corner
    - was because of invalid inputs to atan2/acos - zero vector
- 3D
